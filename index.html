                    <h2>Spider-Man: Your Friendly Neighborhood Hero!</h2>
                    <p>After an encounter with a spider, our hero, Peter Parker (aka: Spider-Man), has gained some incredible abilities.  He can cling to walls, 
                        has superhuman strength, and a tingling spider-sense.  He can also shoot webs from custom designed web-shooters.</p>
                    <p>Instead of abusing his powers, Spider-Man uses his powers to do good.  He patrols the community he lives in and tries to help everyone that
                        needs it.  For Spider-Man, no problem is too small!
                    </p>
                    <p>From time to time though, Spider-Man has to face off against massive villains.  He has defended our neighboor several times by defeating
                        several villains.  Here is just a small list of the evil-doers Spider-Man has faced:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Chameleon</li>
                        <li>The Vulture</li>
                        <li>Doctor Octopus</li>
                        <li>The Sandman</li>
                        <li>The Lizard</li>
                        <li>Electro</li>
                        <li>Mysterio</li>
                        <li>The Green Goblin</li>
